    <h1>The Prostitution in Nigeria</h1>

    <section>
        <article>
            In Nigeria a lot of young girls are forced by their parents to go to Europe to bring money to support their families. In Nigeria the voice of the elders is very important to a child either you do what your parents say to do or you are a shame from your family.

    <h2>Leave ?</h2> 
<br>
    To go to Europe you have to find a smuggler who has some "contacts", the smugglers say that they will find you a job to help elderly people, then he will make you do a "Ceremony" at a Juju, for  supposedly a  protection for the crossing once there-down the girl dresses in white the Sorcerer Juju makes a ritual 
    during which he makes a Grigri composed of nail and hair of the girl and sacrifices a chicken 
    to :"Give blood to God". Once the Pact made the girl is bound to her, a mama is a woman who will charge her once in Europe and whom the young woman will have to pay her debt every month because if she doesn't do it the Juju will kill her.

    <h2>Descend in hell </h2>
    In Europe, she calls their Mama so that she can come and get her. The disappointments will follow for these young girls, from nearby the Mama says that they must reimburse the travel expenses of 45,000 to 60,000 €.
 
    They are told that there is no work for black women and that their only means of survival is Prostitution. Knowing that some Mama asks 1000 Euros per week but she doesn't succeed because the rates are very low for a sexual acts
    approximately 20 €.

    They are therefore blocked in this loop without having an exit because if :


<ul>
    <li>She stops paying or trying to run away from the Mama’s will remind them of their pact and the Nigeria is a very believing country. The "Pact" has a lot of impact on young girls.</li>
    <li>They can’t go back to Nigeria because the Si elle en parle à quelqu'un, les Mama le savent car elles sont surveillées constamment et elles ne se confient à personne car elles ne parlent pas la langue et elles ont honte. return is as dangerous as the crossing and even if they do, their family will disown them because they came back without money and therefore it would be a failure in their eyes.</li>
    <li>If she talks to someone about it, mama knows it because she is constantly being watched and she doesn't tell anyone because she doesn't speak the language and she is ashamed.</li>
</ul>
 
 
The only people to whom they entrust themselves are the Sisters of the Church who often come to see them.

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<br>

Or in the longer term the main problem is the demand because it’s the demand that pays the Mafia and motivates them to bring back other women who are not informed about the trafficking of prostitutes, And it’s very complicated to trace the source of the traffic because the Nigerians don’t talk much out of fear of reprisals, the little that he speaks allows to catch the Mama but that’s not what organizes the traffic. These are men who pull the strings and he just organizes the traffic and gets the money.
 
They are stuck in this loop. The best way to get away is to run away thanks to an association, especially because a lot of associations exist but they do not have a lot of background and are often small.
But some associations come to them and provide them with housing so that they can take training so that they can get a contract. Very few manage to escape this cage and live a normal life.
